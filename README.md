In an effort to impart a sense of simplicity and a user-friendly aesthetic to the website, I have seamlessly integrated [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [Hind Guntur](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hind+Guntur) and [Montserrat Alternate](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Montserrat+Alternates), with a sans-serif fallback.
